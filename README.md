# Spatial Econometric Interaction Models

This package was designed to analyze Spatial Econometric Interaction Models, use them for prediction purposes, and then analyze those predictions.

The main functionalities are:
* Expected value-based prediction
* Spatial dependence analysis of predicted residuals (Moran scatterplot)
* Scatterplot of predicted vs. observed values for multiple models at side-by-side for easy comparison
* Elasticities calculator based on LeSage and Pace, 2015 (work in progress)
